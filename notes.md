# Shaders
* For ads shading, the following types of vectors are needed in calculation:
  1. n: vertex normal in eye space, normalized vector;
  2. ve: vertex position in eye space;
  3. light position in eye space;
  4. s = light pos in eyespace - ve, normalized vector;
  5. r: the reflection of -s regarding n, normalized vector;
  6. v: the direction of where we are looking at in eye space, i.e. normalize(-ve), normalized vector.
  7. h: the halfway vector between s and v, i.e. normalize(s + v), normalized vector.
* We will be using gl_VertexIndex to generate a fullscreen triangle that acts like a fullscreen quad. Why a triangle? Because it only requires 3 vertex shader invocations (instead of 6 for a quad made up of two triangles). The triangle contains our whole screen and with that the whole uv range of [0..1] so that we can use it like a normal fullscreen quad for applying a post processing effect. Thanks to the GPU clipping everything outside of the screen boundaries we actually get a quad that only requires 3 vertices. And since clipping is for free, we wonâ€™t waste bandwitdh as the clipped parts of the triangle (grayed out parts) are not sampled.
